What is Lorem Ipsum?

<br>
<p class="cardp">
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's<br>
 standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to <br>
make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
 remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing<br> 
Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a <br>
page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal <br>
distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look <br>
like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default <br>
model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <br>
Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
